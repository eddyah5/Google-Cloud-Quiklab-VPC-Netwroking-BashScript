# Google-Cloud-Quiklab-VPC-Netwroking-BashScript
Google Cloud Quiklab: VPC Networking Bash script is a piece of bash script code I wrote to automate all the tasks in this Google cloud Quiklab.
This was a requirement during the project phase of my Google Cloud Associate Engineer internship (6 months).
